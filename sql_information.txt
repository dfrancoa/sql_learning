SQL information

Commands:
 
SELECT
 Every SQL query will begin with the SELECT command to fetch data from one or more tables. SELECT is used every time you want to query data from a database and * means all columns.

 Example:
   SELECT * FROM <table_name>;                 #everything form all columns

   SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name;    #info just from column1 and 2

AS query
 Knowing how SELECT works, AS is a keyword in SQL that allows you to rename a column or a table using an alias. the name con be anything you want as long as you put it inside of single quotes.

 Example:
   SELECT name AS 'Titles' FROM movies;   #Here we renamed the name column as Titles.

 > Although it’s not always necessary, it is considered best practice to surround your aliases with single quotes.
   - Note that this practice is specific to SQLite. When you work with other RDBMSs, notably PostgreSQL, no quotes or double quotes may be required in place of single quotes.
   - When using AS, the columns are not being renamed in the table. The aliases only appear in the result.






Example, table creation and manipulation:

Create table:

CREATE TABLE friends (
   id INTEGER,
   name TEXT,
   birthday DATE
);


Add into row information:

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (1, 'Ororo Munroe', '1940-05-30');

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (2, 'Ivan', '1982-09-09');

INSERT INTO friends (id, name, birthday) 
VALUES (3, 'Edder', '1985-04-05');


Updating a row:

UPDATE friends
SET name = 'Storm'
WHERE id = 1;


Adding a column into table:

ALTER TABLE friends 
ADD COLUMN email TEXT; 


Updating row:

UPDATE friends
SET email = 'storm@codecademy.com'
WHERE id = 1;

UPDATE friends
SET email = 'ivan@codecademy.com'
WHERE id = 2;

UPDATE friends
SET email = 'edder@codecademy.com'
WHERE id = 3;


Deleting row 1 from table:

DELETE FROM friends
WHERE id = 1;


Adding more columns to table:

ALTER TABLE friends 
ADD COLUMN phone TEXT;

ALTER TABLE friends 
ADD COLUMN instagram TEXT; 



Updating table with info into new columns that were
just added:

UPDATE friends
SET phone = '6621584798'
WHERE id = 2;

UPDATE friends
SET phone = '6621581254'
WHERE id = 3;

UPDATE friends
SET instagram = 'ivanshugert'
WHERE id = 2;

UPDATE friends
SET instagram = 'edderashley'
WHERE id = 3;


View everything from table that was created (frinds):

SELECT * 
FROM friends;
